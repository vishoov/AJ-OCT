Node.JS Working

JS runtime that helps our servers to stay live all the time
so that we can respond to maximum requests that we recieve on the server 

Core Concepts 

-> Single Threaded event loop -> every request we send to the server is collect in an event loop, shortens the response time 

-> Non - blocking I/O -> node.js can handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently.

-> Event-driven architecture -> as an event is triggered in the server a callback function is executed

-> Module system -> we can write js code in chunks to reduce unecessary processing of the server
