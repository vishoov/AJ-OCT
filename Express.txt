Express.js 

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web API design and server side application logic

Express is built on top of Node.js for fast and scalable server-side development.

1. npm install express






The express() function creates an express application instance that represents the web server.

This application object provides methods for routing, for features, for security, for middlewares and this acts like a central point for all server configuration and request handling. 


Why express.js is a great tool for writing routes

-> lets us use the request data as req
and response data as res

JSON files have 2 parts

header -> contains the technical specifications of json
body -> data that we want to transmit
