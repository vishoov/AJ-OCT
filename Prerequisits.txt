RESTful API Architecture 

- Representational State Transfer is an architectural style for designing APIS that are scalable,robust and secure

-in APIs we use HTTP requests and methods to perform CRUD operations on resources treating data as a resource

- Statelessness -> each API request contains all the information that is required for processing of the data from the server to the client 

- Resouce - Based Architecture -> 1 feature = 1 route 

- Uniform interface -> include consistent interaction patterns across the API
