Mongoose is ODM -> Object Data Modelling tool 

this is used as a driver for

- connecting to the database 
- defining a schema (useful for validation of data)
- querying = fetch, add, update, remove


client ----API-----server ---mongoose= (DB URI) ---- mongoDB


email-> vishoo@.com
password-> abc

Data Validation and Modelling 

- data integrity 

username
email
password
age


- security 

password -> longer the password, harder it is to crack it 

- uniform 

role based authentication 

user 

name,
email,
password,
role => user, guest, admin, superadmin


How is data stored in mongoDB

Cluster -> Database -> Collections -> documents (json object for a single data entity) 

Collections in mongoDB are like tables where we store similar kind of data together for organization purposes


Whenevr we write a schema it is always implemented in a single collection 
and both of these things combined 
schema + collection = model!
