Validation is the process of cross checking the data to make sure if it is in required format, or not


Mongoose provides a powerful and flexible way of validating the data before saving it to the MongoDB


req--->server ---> validate ----> DB
                  (mongoose)


Validators Types:-

1. Built-in 

a. required -> ensures a field should be present 
require:true-> this will send an error if that field is missing 

b. unqiue -> ensures that the data we have entered in the field should not be duplicated 
the value in the field should be only present in one document not duplicated 

c. Number Validators 
min -> minimum value of the number that we can add
max -> max permitted value of the number that we can add

d. String Validators

inputting strings -> 

minLength -> string should be atleast of this length -> 'ball' -> 4 character  
maxLength -> stirng can be at max of this length 
enum -> restricts the permitted values of the string 
match -> pattern matching using RegEx


e. Custom Validator 

validate :{
    validator: function(arg){

    }
}


Options -> 

1. select -> if we want to hide any data in queries for security 

select:false-> it will exclude the data from the query that is being sent to the server 


Querying 
limit
