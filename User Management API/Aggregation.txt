Aggregation pipelines are sequence of data transformations and processing applied step-by-step to the data coming from the database one by one to shape the data according to our requirements;


benefits of aggregation?

1. efficient data processing : transform the data directly in the database 
2. scalable analytics : we can process huge amounts of datasets efficiently with optimizations for lower latency 
3. flexibility in transformation : multiple stages that shape, process, count, analyse, and perform complex calculations
4. NON DESTRUCTIVE IN NATURE
